      "\n",
      "My general approach was to use simple debugging on this problem. I don't believe I could have sped things up too significantly using heavier tools. First, I examined the code to understand its function. During this first once over, several errors and potential errors stood out (clear syntax errors and order of operations that could be clarified). I also searched for a few 'dirty programmer tricks' that I had run into in the past; for example, replacing a number '1' with a lower case 'l' in many fonts results in an error without being obvious. After correcting the obvious errors, I attempted a run. This uncovered that I had made an incorrect assumption about the .function_calls variable, thinking it a function. I also saw that I needed to move the sum() outside of the list comprehension. \n",
      "\n",
      "After re-running, I notice that I was not getting what I expected out of the list comprehension; I was getting tuples instead of ints. Later on, reviewing the code for the optimizers, I think I see where this comes from. At the time I simply included an index to pluck out the integer I wanted. Once those errors were cleared away I could next see that only a single optimizer was actually running. My first approach was to confirm that it was related to the ordering, not a specific optimizer. After looking over the code and not finding any hints, I placed a few print statements in the function calls. This confirmed that the other iterators were being called but not functioning. One of my print statements returned an iterator object. This was the clear pointer to the final problem. Realizing the iterator was not refreshed on each pass, I placed it inside the for loop, solving the final problem.\n",
