      "I didn't use any debugging tools to resolve the issues.  I noticed the code didn't run, so I looked for something that would make it text and removed the ticks.  Then I read through the code an looked for obvious errors.  I reformatted it to make it a little easier to read.  It was crashing with an error about int/tupple in a complex command line.  I tried exploring the list comprehensions with the product, but that didn't seem to be the issue.  I eventually noticed that there was a comma in the return value of the function it was calling, which was creating the tupple.  When this was removed there were no more runtime errors, but the last three function were reporting no calls.  It took some time to figure this out, but I tested calling the functions independently and noticed that the product won't run in a list more than once.  I moved the definition in the loop, which produced the remaining values.  They weren't exactly the same but close.  I reran it several times and each time was different but similar results. \n",
