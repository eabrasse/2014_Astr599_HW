When it is used in bench_optimizer, it is used in apply_optimizer, which returns the result of \"optimizer\" as a tag for one of the functions in OPTIMIZERS.

      "It shouldn't matter but I noticed that in the compare_optimizers function, the input call is \"optimizers\", not \"OPTIMIZERS\". I wonder if it makes a difference. I'll put it in all caps just in case. Did not make a difference.\n",

I'm wondering if it has something to do with the properties of generators like param_grid, and I struggle because it's easy to just think of the generator as a tuple and it's not at all like that. I'm thinking something happens to the generator when you try to generate it twice in a row, so I'm going to call it fresh again in the OPTIMIZERS loop in compare_optimizers.\n",
