Homework 8 Debugging Log:

An initial inspection of the code yielded a potential bug where compare_optimizers was using the global variable OPTIMIZERS as opposed to the function input. To overcome the first error thrown (an invalid operator) in 'bench_optimizer', the nested loop within the sum function was not working as intended. The for loop was broken out and a variable called ncalls was explicitly used. The compare_optimizers executes, but the output for anything other than the first function returns a function call of 0. Testing each algorithm individually using a separate driver routine yields the expected behavior. Something was likely wrong with the iterators. The 'product' function was the implicated cause of the error because the optimizer name suggested that the for loop in 'compare_optimizers' was behaving as expected. Moving the 'product' line inside of the for-loop corrects the problem and the script yields the expected behavior.
